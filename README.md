# New Game by Pablo Ortiz!

This is a new game based on Paper, Scissors and Rock learned at class.

Inspired by a similar game that my son currently plays with his friends where he basically uses the same mechanics but with different options or "weapons".

In this new case Rock is replaced for Rabbit.
Paper is replaced for Gun.
Finally Scissors is replaced for Wall.

So ... Rabbit is killed by a Gun, Gun is crushed by a Wall and Wall is jumped by a Rabbit.

Now we will try to make this game look better in the terminal window.


Thanks to the professor Trevor for teaches this, for me have been a quite difficult but the important thing is try to improved.
Thanks to my son to show me a new way to play this popular game.
